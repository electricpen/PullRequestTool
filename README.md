# PullRequestTool
An automated tool for checking pull request workflow

This simple webtool utilizes the google sheets and github apis to automate checking pull requests for groups of people to verify that they are using proper git workflow and are getting their code reviewed before merging to master. In addition it provides some analytic data to be able to quickly see how your groups are doing at a glance and highlighting standout code reviews.
